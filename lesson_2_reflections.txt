What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- a ghost .git file is created in the folder. git starts to keep track of what is done to the file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- It’s a space between the directory and the repo, i’m still not sure why it exists.
